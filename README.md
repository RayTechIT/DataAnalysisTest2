# DataAnalysis
In this SQL Project for Data Analysis, I'll will efficiently leverage various analytical features and functions accessible through SQL in PostgreSQL


## What is the Agenda of the project?

The project’s Agenda involves Analyzing the data using **SQL** on the **PostgreSQL**. We first download the **PostgreSQL** from the official PostgreSQL website and understand the problem. Then a Password is set up for the “postgres” username during the setup of **PostgreSQL** software. Then SQL Plus is used to connect to **pgadmin** using the same credentials of the **PostgreSQL**. 

Further, a Database connection is established from pgadmin to the **PostgreSQL** using the “postgres” username and the password. Then tables are created in the database followed by data insertion into tables and exploration, i.e., 

## Working Sessions:

Day_1: SELECT, WHERE, LIMIT and ORDERBY
DAY_2: JOINS
DAY_3: SUB QUERIES and GROUPBY

## Push the code to repo:

### To create a new branch
`git checkout -b "day_1"`

### To add all the changes
`git add .`

### Committing all the changes we have made for the day
`git commit -m "day_1"`

### Pushing all the code
`git push -u origin day_1`
